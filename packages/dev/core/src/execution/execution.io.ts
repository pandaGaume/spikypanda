 * downstream nodes should see the same upstream value within one tick.

 *
 * The historical name kept "first output" wording because the original
 * 1-slot scheduler did not fan out: a node had at most one wire per
 * port and publish needed to land on that one wire. The FIFO refactor
 * does not change that constraint per channel, but a single output
 * port may now feed N destinations (Clock.t → Divide AND Comparator);
 * we have to publish on each, not just `outs[0]`.
 *
 * Multi-output nodes (Branch with `true`/`false`, RunnableNode with
 * `_started`/`_stopped`, ...) intentionally do NOT use this helper —
 * they iterate onsc themselves and key on slot. Here we mirror that
 * pattern but pin the slot to whatever the first onsc channel happens
 * to advertise, which matches the single-output-port contract this
 * function is documented for.
