/**
 * Concrete ISession built on **per-node input buffers**.

 * Each destination node owns one FIFO queue per incoming slot. A
 * `publish(linkIdx, value)` does NOT write into a per-channel slot;
 * it enqueues a `LinkRef { linkIndex, value }` onto the session's
 * scheduler queue. The scheduler drains the queue, alternating
 * between LinkRefs (which append the value into the destination's
 * slot buffer and queue the destination for a fire-check) and node
 * dispatches (which fire when every gating buffer is non-empty,
 * consuming exactly one token per slot per fire).
 *
 * The previous 1-slot `ILinkState` surface is kept as a derived view
 * (`linkStates` proxy), so existing nodes that probe
 * `session.linkStates[idx].ready` keep working transparently.
 *
 * Capacity per slot is sourced from the source port descriptor when
 * available (via {@link IRuntimeNode} declarations) and otherwise
 * defaults to 1, preserving historical 1-slot semantics for nodes that
 * have not been migrated to declare loop-friendly capacities.
