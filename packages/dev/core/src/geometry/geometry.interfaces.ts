 * `Matrix4.elements`, WebGL / glsl `mat4`). This ordering lets us
 * upload the buffer to a GPU shader uniform with zero transposition.

 * rotation × non-uniform scale, and the bottom row is `[0, 0, 0, 1]`
 * for affine transforms.

 * The interface is intentionally narrow (just the buffer) so a plain
 * `Float64Array` of length 16 satisfies it structurally — useful for
 * the SceneStateView, which may return a matrix that lives in a
 * scratch buffer the consumer is expected to read-and-discard rather

 * on demand into a local matrix, chained through a `parent` to yield the
 * world matrix `parent.worldTransform() × localTransform()`.
 *
 * Pure geometry: no runtime, session, port, or `fire` concept appears
 * here. Every data member is optional, so a non-spatial node (most
 * neurons) carries nothing and pays nothing; the matrices are cached on
 * the node and produced lazily, only when `localTransform()` /
 * `worldTransform()` are actually called. A port-fed `local` override or a
 * scene-parent fallback is the SIM layer's concern, layered on top by
 * overriding these methods — it never leaks into this contract.
 *
 * READ-ONLY RETURN CONTRACT: `localTransform()` / `worldTransform()` return
 * BORROWED, reused buffers, valid only until this node's next transform
 * call (the implementation reuses them to stay allocation-free). Callers
 * MUST NOT mutate the result; copy it (`toFlat` / `copyFrom`) to retain or
 * modify. In particular a root node's `worldTransform()` may return the very
 * SAME instance as its `localTransform()`, so mutating one would corrupt the
 * other.
