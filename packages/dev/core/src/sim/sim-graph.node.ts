/**
 * `Sim.Graph:graph` — the explicit fractal-container RuntimeNode.
 *
 * The runtime already supports fractal sub-graphs via `RuntimeGraph` +
 * `IGraphNodeState.internalSession` (each parent session that embeds a
 * RuntimeGraph allocates a distinct inner Session, so the same graph
 * topology can be embedded by N parents without state sharing). That
 * mechanism was invisible on the canvas; SimGraphNode promotes it to a
 * palette-droppable entity with the two extra contracts the v2
 * architecture needs:
 *
 *   1. **Scene binding** — `@cloneable sceneItemId` points at a
 *      SceneItem (a `GraphItem`) living in the same canvas. At
 *      `reset(parentSession)`, the editor's session-builder hands the
 *      SimGraphNode a `SceneStateViewResolver` that maps the ID to a
 *      live `SceneStateView`; the view is written into
 *      `innerSession.sceneStateView` so every TransformNode-derived
 *      node inside this sub-graph reads its gravity / temperature /
 *      transform from the wired Scene rather than from a default.
 *
 *   2. **Multi-rate sub-stepping** — `fire(parentSession, t)`
 *      computes the ratio K = innerHz / parentHz at every call (cheap;
 *      both Hz values are getters on the bound SceneStateView), then
 *      runs `innerSession.run()` K times between the parent's previous
 *      and current sim-time. Inputs are routed in ONCE before the
 *      sub-step loop (ZOH semantics — the inner integrator sees the
 *      parent's last-published value held across K micro-steps) and
 *      outputs routed out ONCE after, matching the F9 / `Helios.Sim:rate-group`
 *      design. K is clamped to ≥ 1, so a child with a slower (or
 *      identical) rate falls back to a single inner.run per parent
 *      fire.
 *
 * Solver attachment to the inner session lands in P4 (Solver-node
 * refactor); V1 of this node only wires the SceneStateView and runs
 * the sub-step loop.
 *
 * Inheritance choice: SimGraphNode subclasses `RuntimeGraph` rather
 * than composing one. Subclassing reuses the input/output port
 * routing, the IGraphNodeState factory, the control plane, and the
 * `reset()` cascade for free; the only new code paths are the scene
 * binding in reset() and the K-loop in fire().

/**
 * Resolver protocol the editor's session-builder hands to a

 * lookups the SimGraphNode needs at `reset()`:
 *
 *   - `buildView`: map a `sceneItemId` (the SceneItem's editor
 *     identity) to a live `SceneStateView` bound to the calling
 *     SimGraphNode's inner session.
 *   - `buildSolverAttachments`: enumerate the solvers wired to the
 *     SceneItem (via its `solverItemIds`), build each one's
 *     `ISolverHandle` instance from its editables, register the leaves
 *     it owns, and return the handles ready for `inner.attachSolver`.
 *
 * Both lookups are scoped to the same SceneItem, which is why they
 * live on a single interface rather than two parallel function-style
 * resolvers — the editor implements the two together and the
 * SimGraphNode invokes both inside the same reset() pass.
 *
 * Returns `null` / empty when the ID is unknown (item missing / not
 * yet created / typo) — SimGraphNode falls back to a default view
 * silently rather than throwing, matching the editor's tolerance for
 * transient invalid wirings during topology edits.
 *
 * Core has no SceneItem class (that lives in `plugins/physics/scene`)
 * and no concrete SolverNode (those live in `plugins/control/sim`),
 * so this interface is the seam that lets the editor wire all three
 * together without pulling the plugin layer into core's import graph.
