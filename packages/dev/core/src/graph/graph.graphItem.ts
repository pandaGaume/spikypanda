     * and persistent runtime state (counters, accumulators, last poses).
     *
     * The rule: any port input that has NO incoming wire falls back to
     * the matching editable, so the editable IS the live value and must
     * persist. We treat every `@cloneable` field as belonging to that
     * persistable set — same metadata Reflect-key as clone() so the
     * two operations stay in sync (cloneable ⇔ savable, by construction).
     *
     * Field handling:
     *   - Primitives (number / boolean / string / null) pass through
     *   - Class instances with own enumerable props (Cartesian3, etc.)
     *     are spread to a plain `{...obj}` snapshot — the type is
     *     reconstructed in deserialize() by Object.assign'ing back into
     *     the live instance, preserving the prototype + methods
     *   - Typed arrays are intentionally NOT supported in V1: they're
     *     almost always runtime state that should be excluded from
     *     @cloneable anyway. Future support would JSON-encode them
     *     under a sentinel wrapper.
     *
     * Returns a plain object suitable for `JSON.stringify`.

     *
     * For class-instance fields we use Object.assign onto the live
     * instance instead of replacing the reference. Two reasons:
     *   1. Preserves the prototype + methods (Cartesian3.distance(),
     *      etc.) — the vector3 editor relies on `cur.constructor` for
     *      its rebuild path, which only works on a real Cartesian3.
     *   2. Avoids firing setField (which expects to be called by the
     *      user via the @editable setter, not by load). The runtime
     *      sees the new value on the very next tick.
