/**
 * Editor schema: declarative metadata describing which properties of a
 * model object are editable or merely viewable, paired with a "kind"
 * string that an editor host resolves to a concrete UI factory.
 *
 * Two decorators live here:
 *
 *   @editor("transform-3d")  - class decorator. Declares that the class
 *     has a custom whole-object editor identified by the given kind.
 *     Editor hosts (e.g. the property panel) can offer a dedicated tab
 *     when a registry has a factory for that kind.
 *
 *   @editable("vector3")     - property decorator. Marks the property
 *     as user-editable; the kind selects which sub-editor renders it.
 *
 *   @viewable("matrix4")     - property decorator. Marks the property
 *     as read-only (computed, derived, immutable from the UI's view);
 *     the kind selects which sub-editor visualises it.
 *
 * The declaration is intentionally side-effect free: no UI is wired
 * here, no registry is touched. The view side (nodeeditor) reads the
 * schema via getEditorSchema() and resolves kinds through its own
 * registry.
 *
 * Storage follows the same metadata pattern as @cloneable: the class
 * decorator writes to the constructor, property decorators accumulate
 * on the prototype. Reflect.getMetadata walks the prototype/constructor
 * chains, so subclasses see inherited fields and an inherited class
 * editor unless they override.
